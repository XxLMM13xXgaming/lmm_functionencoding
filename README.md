1.) put your function inside the functiontoencode brackets

2.) Take out the -- by the functiontoencode and the 2 prints below it..

3.) locate in console the numbers below 'HERE IS THE CODE: ' and copy

4.) Place the numbers in the theencodedcode table brackets and place ,'s after each number except the last (also make sure there is no space inbetween this may take a while)

5.) put -- at the start of each functon just like you found when you got the addon...

6.) take out the --'s where you see theencodedcode, string.Implode and everything below that.. Now run the code.. make sure everything works...

  NOTE: If there are errors it is either with the theencodedcode not being in the right format OR your function has a error!

7.) In your addon's code put theencodedcode with the encoded code and string.Implode and below..

Thanks!
